# BlueROV2 - Koopman & Fossen Dynamics

A unified, working codebase for modeling, training, and evaluating **BlueROV2** underwater vehicle dynamics using:

- **Data-driven Koopman models (EDMDc)**
- **Physics-based models (Fossen-style BlueROV2 dynamics)**
- **Some other popular alternatives (PINN)**

The repository supports both **simulation** and **tank/recorded** datasets, with scripts for training, evaluation, and generating comparison visuals.

> 📚 For background and detailed physics documentation of the BlueROV2 model, see the [README](fossen/README.md).


## ✨ Key Features

- **Koopman EDMDc** with configurable dictionaries (e.g., RBF) and regularization
- **Physics baseline** (Fossen-style) for apples-to-apples comparisons
- **Evaluation tooling** for one-step and multi-step RMSE
- **Open-loop rollouts & visualizations** (plots/animations)
- **ROS bag → CSV helpers** for real/tank data pipelines
- Clean package layout with **editable install** for cross-module imports


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Cloning

Clone the repo using HTTPS or SSH:
```bash
# For example, using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/ViktorNfa/bluerov2_dynamics.git
```

The repo uses Git LFS for the database files which are quite large, so remember to do:
```bash
cd bluerov2_dynamics
git lfs pull
```

If you don't have Git LFS you might have to install it first:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git-lfs
git lfs install
```

### 2) Environment

I recommend to install uv to manage the virtual environment (venv), so you just have to:
```bash
# 1) Install uv (once)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 2) Create and activate a local virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you don't want uv you can also just use venv:
```bash
# (Windows, macOS, Linux)
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 3) Install
If you use uv you can install the project (editable) + dependencies from pyproject.toml as:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

Or you can also install it manually as:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This makes the code importable anywhere in the repo, e.g.,
```bash
from Koopman.koopmanEDMDc import KoopmanEDMDc
# and/or
from fossen import ...
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running the code from VSCode remember to change the python executable
> from the default `/bin/python` to the one in your `.venv` file.
>
> This can be done manually using:
> 1. Open Command Palette → **Python: Select Interpreter**
> 2. Pick: `.../bluerov2_dynamics/.venv/bin/python`
> 3. Then the Run/Play button will use the venv and the import will work.
>
> Or automatically, by creating a `bluerov2_dynamics/.vscode/settings.json`
> file with the following inside:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python"
> }
> ```

### 4) Dependencies

```pyproject.toml``` already install all the main dependencies, but in case it fails, the core stack is light-weight:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn pandas matplotlib torch rosbags openpyxl
```

If you plan to export MP4 animations, install ```ffmpeg``` and ensure it’s on your system ```PATH```.

> [!NOTE]
> There is also a ```uv.lock``` file for those that want specific dependencies, use it with
> ```bash
> uv venv
> uv sync
> uv pip install -e .
> ```


## 📦 Data

**Recorded datasets** are expected as CSV files (commonly exported at **50 Hz**). Typical columns:

- **State (12)**: ```x, y, z, phi, theta, psi, u, v, w, p, q, r```.
- **Inputs**: e.g., thruster commands ```u1 ... u8``` (unused inputs can be zeroed)
- **Sampling**: constant ```dt``` (e.g., 0.02 s for 50 Hz)

Helpers for converting ROS2 bag → CSV live under the ```rosbags/``` area of the repo.


## 🧪 Workflows

The repository ships with ready-to-run scripts. The exact script names may vary; look inside the ```training/``` (or similarly named) folder and pick the one that matches your use case.

### A) Train on Simulation (Koopman vs. Physics)
```bash
python training/<your_sim_training_script>.py
```

- Simulates BlueROV2 trajectories.
- Fits **Koopman EDMDc** (configurable dictionary/regularization).
- Reports **one-step** and **multi-step** RMSE.
- Optionally saves an **open-loop** comparison animation under ```media/```.

### B) Train on Recorded/Tank Data
```bash
python training/<your_recorded_training_script>.py
```

- Loads the latest or specified CSV dataset.
- Trains **Koopman** and compares against **Fossen** physics.
- Reports RMSE for selected horizons (e.g., H=1, 10, 100).
- Saves figures/animations to ```media/```.


## 🗂️ Repository Layout (high-level)
```graphql
.
├─ Koopman/          # Data-driven Koopman models (EDMDc, kernels, etc.)
├─ fossen/           # Physics-based BlueROV2 dynamics (Fossen-style)
├─ training/         # Training & evaluation entry points (simulation/recorded)
├─ rosbags/          # Rosbag→CSV converters and (optionally) exported datasets
├─ media/            # Plots/animations generated by scripts
├─ pyproject.toml    # Editable install for clean cross-module imports
├─ README.md         # You're here 👋
└─ LICENSE
```

This layout allows clean imports from anywhere (after ```pip install -e .```).


## 📊 Results & Artifacts

- **Metrics**: printed to console (and optionally saved as CSV when enabled).
- **Visuals**: plots/animations written to ```media/```.
- **Reproducibility**: you can organize runs under ```rosbags/YYYY-MM-DD_*``` if desired.


## 🤝 Contributing

- Keep algorithm code modular (e.g., under ```Koopman/``` or ```fossen/```).
- Put run-specific logic in ```training/```.
- Add small, focused unit tests where practical.
- Use clear docstrings and type hints for new utilities.
